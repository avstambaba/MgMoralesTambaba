**WEBSITE TITLE: All About the LGBTQIA+ Community**

DESCRIPTION: This website discusses the LGBTQIA+ community, its definitions, social issues, and types. Our goal is for everyone to be aware and accepting of all genders and sexualities. We should all be welcoming to all people and not act against them just because of their gender or sexuality. We need to learn that we are not defined by whom we love or whom we are attracted to and that it is not “abnormal” to not like people of the opposite gender.

TITLE: How LGBTQIA+ Came To Be

In a survey conducted by Pew Research Center, the Philippines was ranked #1 in the most LGBTQIA+ friendly nations in Asia. Filipinos have also developed their own slang called “gaylingo” which is combined with the Filipino language. In terms of politics and social standing, it can be said that members of the community are only tolerated and not accepted in the society as discrimination against them still remains, and the laws that allow more freedom for them (i.e. same sex marriage, etc.) are still not passed.

TITLE: LGBTQIA: The Acronym

L (Lesbian) - lesbians are women that are attracted to other women.

G (Gay) - the term usually refers to homosexual men. But it can also be used for people who just feel romantic attraction towards people of the same gender.

B (Bisexual) - they are people who are attracted to both genders (women and men).

T (Transgender) - transgender people are people that identify as the opposite of their biological sex.

Q (Queer) - the word queer is an umbrella term used for people who identify as anything but heterosexual.

I (Intersex) - intersex refers to people born with both female and male characteristics.

A (Asexual) - people that identify as asexual are people who feel no sexual attraction towards anyone.

All LGBTQIA+ members prefer to go by specific pronouns. A couple examples would be she/her, he/him and they/them. One could also use  any pronouns, or a combination of both like she/they, he/they, and many more.
